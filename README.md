## Notable features

At its heart, this project looks like any Astro project, you can start by reading my entry ["Launching a blog with Astro"](https://goulven-clech.dev/2023/launching-blog-astro). But, little by little, I added some original features that might interest you, here are the main ones:

- [Search bar](https://github.com/goulvenclech/goulven-clech.dev/blob/master/src/components/Search.astro): made with Astro and Web Components only, filter blog entries based on user's input.

- [Catalogue](https://goulven-clech.dev/catalogue): personal media log with full-text search, multi-criteria filters (source, emotions, rating) and paginated loading. Powered by Astro API routes deployed as Netlify Functions, with data persisted in a Turso (SQLite) edge database.

- [Friends](https://goulven-clech.dev/friends): interactive graph visualization of my and my friends' websites, powered by [GraphGarden](https://github.com/bruits/graphgarden).

- [Table of contents](https://github.com/goulvenclech/goulven-clech.dev/blob/master/src/components/TableOfContent.astro): using Astro and MDX, generate a table of contents based on the headings. With nested lists.

- [Open Library](https://github.com/goulvenclech/goulven-clech.dev/blob/master/src/components/blocks/BookBlock.astro) & [Google Maps](https://github.com/goulvenclech/goulven-clech.dev/blob/master/src/components/blocks/MapsBlock.astro) blocks: nicely displays API results in blog entries.

- [Dark mode](https://github.com/goulvenclech/goulven-clech.dev/blob/master/src/components/controls/DarkMode.astro): toggle between light, dark, and system color schemes. Use local storage to persist the user's choice.

- [Custom image service](https://github.com/goulvenclech/goulven-clech.dev/blob/master/src/imageService.ts): retrieved from [Erika's blog](https://erika.florist/), gain performance and display a placeholder during image loading.

## Philosophy

_Work in progress_.
