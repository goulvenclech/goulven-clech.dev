My personnal blog, made with [Astro](https://docs.astro.build), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) & [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). Live at [goulven-clech.dev](https://goulven-clech.dev), hosted by [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

## Notable features

At its heart, this project looks like any blog made with Astro, you can start by reading my article ["Launching a blog with Astro"](https://goulven-clech.dev/2023/launching-blog-astro). But, little by little, I added some original features that might interest you, here are the main ones:

- [Search bar](https://github.com/goulvenclech/goulven-clech.dev/blob/master/src/components/Search.astro): made with Astro and Web Components only, filter blog entries based on user's input.

- [Table of contents](https://github.com/goulvenclech/goulven-clech.dev/blob/master/src/components/TableOfContent.astro): using Astro and MDX, generate a table of contents based on the headings. With nested lists.

- [Open Library](https://github.com/goulvenclech/goulven-clech.dev/blob/master/src/components/blocks/BookBlock.astro) & [Google Maps](https://github.com/goulvenclech/goulven-clech.dev/blob/master/src/components/blocks/MapsBlock.astro) blocks: nicely displays API results in blog entries.

- [Dark mode](https://github.com/goulvenclech/goulven-clech.dev/blob/master/src/components/icons/DarkMode.astro): toggle between light, dark, and system color schemes. Use local storage to persist the user's choice.

- [Custom image service](https://github.com/goulvenclech/goulven-clech.dev/blob/master/src/imageService.ts): retrieved from [Erika's blog](https://erika.florist/), gain performance and display a placeholder during image loading.
